@OldhamCouncil @Katrina_1503 aren‚Äôt you embarrassed that Oldham‚Äôs COVID-19 is 20x higher than the national average? Enforce the wearing of face masks in shops and public places. Enforce social distancing. Do the right thing. Do something.,0
"Covid-19 IS an American failure story.  The democrat states increased deaths by more than 300% over Sweden levels (no locks, few masks).  We then blocked HCQ increasing deaths by as much as another 376%.  This was all done by the radical left.",1
Ok Simone are you really ready to transfer this mess... HCQ is a cure for a lot of thinks. It is working on DNA as well. HCQ is good for all virus! With fall coming + flu + masks =immun=down=people will dye from the flu! Study this and do another conference!,1

"None of these. I am under 70 yo, very healthy. Covid poses no risk for me. The only reason to take vax is when the risk of virus far exceeds the complications of untested vax. For anybody healthy under 65 no need for vax. I don't wear mask, I hug my friends and go to parties.",1
People are eating and drinking....his mask is on the table. Masks don't really work in everyday situations. 98 percent survival rate with this virus. Look at Sweden. WP is silly horse face.,1
